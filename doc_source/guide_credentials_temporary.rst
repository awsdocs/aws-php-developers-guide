Using Temporary Credentials from |STS|

   :description: How to configure temporary access for AWS services using the AWS SDK for PHP.

:STS-api:`AWS Security Token Service <Welcome>`
(|STS|) enables you to request limited privilege, **temporary credentials**
for AWS |IAM| users, or for users that you authenticate via identity federation.

One common use case for temporary credentials is to grant mobile or
client-side applications access to AWS resources by authenticating users
through third-party identity providers (see :IAM-ug:`Web Identity Federation
<id_roles_providers_oidc>`).

.. note::

    Temporary credentials generated by |STS| are not supported by every
    service. To determine whether the service you are using supports temporary
    credentials, see :iam-ug:`IAM Temporary Security Credentials <id_credentials_temp>`.


Getting Temporary Credentials
=============================

|STS| has several operations that return temporary credentials, but the
``GetSessionToken`` operation is the simplest to demonstrate.
Assuming you have an instance of ``Aws\Sts\StsClient`` stored in the
``$stsClient`` variable, you call it as follows.

.. code-block:: php

    $result = $stsClient->getSessionToken();

The result for ``GetSessionToken`` and the other |STS| operations always
contains a ``'Credentials'`` value. If you print the result
(e.g., ``print_r($result)``), it looks like the following.

::

    Array
    (
        ...
        [Credentials] => Array
        (
            [SessionToken] => '<base64 encoded session token value>'
            [SecretAccessKey] => '<temporary secret access key value>'
            [Expiration] => 2013-11-01T01:57:52Z
            [AccessKeyId] => '<temporary access key value>'
        )
        ...
    )

Providing Temporary Credentials to the |sdk-php|
================================================

You can use temporary credentials with another AWS client by instantiating
the client and passing in the values received from |STS| directly.

.. code-block:: php

    use Aws\S3\S3Client;

    $result = $stsClient->getSessionToken();

    $s3Client = new S3Client([
        'version'     => '2006-03-01',
        'region'      => 'us-west-2',
        'credentials' => [
            'key'    => $result['Credentials']['AccessKeyId'],
            'secret' => $result['Credentials']['SecretAccessKey'],
            'token'  => $result['Credentials']['SessionToken']
        ]
    ]);

You can also construct an ``Aws\Credentials\Credentials`` object and use that
when instantiating the client.

.. code-block:: php

    use Aws\Credentials\Credentials;
    use Aws\S3\S3Client;

    $result = $stsClient->getSessionToken();

    $credentials = new Credentials(
        $result['Credentials']['AccessKeyId'],
        $result['Credentials']['SecretAccessKey'],
        $result['Credentials']['SessionToken']
    );

    $s3Client = new S3Client([
        'version'     => '2006-03-01',
        'region'      => 'us-west-2',
        'credentials' => $credentials
    ]);

However, the *best* way to provide temporary credentials is to use the
``createCredentials()`` helper method included with the ``StsClient``. This
method extracts the data from an |STS| result and creates the ``Credentials``
object for you.

.. code-block:: php

    $result = $stsClient->getSessionToken();
    $credentials = $stsClient->createCredentials($result);

    $s3Client = new S3Client([
        'version'     => '2006-03-01',
        'region'      => 'us-west-2',
        'credentials' => $credentials
    ]);

For more information about why you might need to use temporary credentials in
your application or project, see :iam-ug:`Scenarios for Granting Temporary Access <id_credentials_temp>` in the |STS| documentation.
