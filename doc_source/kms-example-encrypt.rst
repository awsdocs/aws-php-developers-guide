Encrypting and Decrypting |KMS| Data Keys Using the |sdk-php| Version 3

   :description: Use the AWS KMS API to encrypt and decrypt data.
   :keywords: AWS KMS code examples for PHP, encrypt data in PHP, decrypt data in PHP

Data keys are encryption keys that you can use to encrypt data, including large amounts of data and other data encryption keys.

You can use a |KMSlong| (|KMS|) :KMS-dg:`customer master key (CMK)<concepts.html#master_keys>` to generate, encrypt, and decrypt data keys. However, |KMS| does not store, manage, or track your data keys, or perform cryptographic operations with data keys. Use and manage data keys outside of |KMS|.

The following examples show how to:

* Encrypt a data key using :aws-php-class:`Encrypt <api-kms-2014-11-01.html#encrypt>`.
* Decrypt a data key using :aws-php-class:`Decrypt <api-kms-2014-11-01.html#decrypt>`.
* Re-encrypt a data key with a new CMK using :aws-php-class:`ReEncrypt <api-kms-2014-11-01.html#reencrypt>`.

For more information about using |KMSlong| (|KMS|), see the |KMS-dg|_.

Encrypt
=======

The :KMS-api:`Encrypt <API_Encrypt>` operation is designed to encrypt data keys, but it's not frequently used. The :KMS-api:`GenerateDataKey <API_GenerateDataKey>` and
:KMS-api:`GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext <API_GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext>` operations return encrypted data keys. You might use the ``Encypt``
method when you're moving encrypted data to a new AWS Region and want to encrypt its data key by using a CMK in the new Region.

**Sample Code**

.. literalinclude:: kms.php.encrypt.main.txt
   :language: PHP

Decrypt
=======

To decrypt a data key, use the :KMS-api:`Decrypt <API_Decrypt>` operation.

The ``ciphertextBlob`` that you specify must be the value of the ``CiphertextBlob`` field from a :KMS-api:`GenerateDataKey <API_GenerateDataKey>`,
:KMS-api:`GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext <API_GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext>`, or :KMS-api:`Encrypt <API_Encrypt>` response.

Reencrypt
=========

To decrypt an encrypted data key, and then immediately reencrypt the data key under a different CMK, use the
:KMS-api:`ReEncrypt <API_ReEncrypt>` operation. The operations are performed entirely on the server side within |KMS|, so they never expose your plaintext outside of |KMS|.

The ``ciphertextBlob`` that you specify must be the value of the ``CiphertextBlob`` field from a :KMS-api:`GenerateDataKey <API_GenerateDataKey>`,
:KMS-api:`GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext <API_GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext>`, or :KMS-api:`Encrypt <API_Encrypt>` response.
