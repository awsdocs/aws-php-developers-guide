|CWlong| (|CW|) is a web service that monitors your |AWSlong| (AWS) resources and the applications you run on AWS in real time. You can use |CW| to collect and track metrics, which are variables you can measure for your resources and applications. |CW| alarms send notifications or automatically make changes to the resources you are monitoring based on rules that you define.

All the example code for the |sdk-php| is available `here on GitHub <https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/master/php/example_code>`_.
