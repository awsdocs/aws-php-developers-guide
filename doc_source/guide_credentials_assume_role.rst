Using |IAM| Roles for |EC2| Instance Variable Credentials
==========================================================

If you're running your application on an |EC2| instance, the preferred way to provide credentials to
make calls to AWS is to use an :ec2-ug:`IAM role <iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2>`
to get temporary security credentials.

When you use |IAM| roles, you don't need to worry about
credential management from your application. They allow an instance to "assume" a role by retrieving temporary
credentials from the |EC2| instance's metadata server.

The temporary credentials, often referred to as **instance profile credentials**, allow
access to the actions and resources that the role's policy allows. |EC2| handles all the legwork of securely
authenticating instances to the |IAM| service to assume the role, and periodically
refreshing the retrieved role credentials. This keeps your application secure with
almost no work on your part.

.. note::

    Instance profile credentials and other temporary credentials generated by
    the |STSlong| (|STS|) are not supported by every
    service. To determine whether the service you're using supports temporary
    credentials, see :iam-ug:`AWS Services that Support AWS STS <reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam>`.

    To avoid hitting the metadata service every time, you can pass an instance of ``Aws\CacheInterface``
    in as the ``'credentials'`` option to a client constructor. This lets the SDK
    use cached instance profile credentials instead. For details, see :doc:`guide_configuration`.
    
   
Create and Assign an |IAM| Role to an |EC2| Instance
----------------------------------------------------

1. Create an |IAM| client.

    **Imports**

    .. code-block:: php

       require 'vendor/autoload.php';

       use Aws\Iam\IamClient;


    **Sample Code**

    .. code-block:: php

       $client = new IamClient([
           'region' => 'us-west-2',
           'version' => '2010-05-08'
       ]);

2. Create an |IAM| role with the permissions for the actions and resources you'll use.

    **Sample Code**

     .. code-block:: php

       $result = $client->createRole([
           'AssumeRolePolicyDocument' => 'IAM JSON Policy', // REQUIRED
           'Description' => 'Description of Role',
           'RoleName' => 'RoleName', // REQUIRED
       ]);




3. Create an |IAM| instance profile and store the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) from the result.

    .. note::

        If you use the |IAM| console instead of the |sdk-php|, the console creates an instance profile automatically and gives it the same name as the role to which it corresponds.

     **Sample Code**

     .. code-block:: php

       $IPN = 'InstanceProfileName';

       $result = $client->createInstanceProfile([
           'InstanceProfileName' => $IPN ,
       ]);

       $ARN = $result['Arn'];
       $InstanceID =  $result['InstanceProfileId'];



4. Create an |EC2| client.

    **Imports**

    .. code-block:: php

       require 'vendor/autoload.php';

       use Aws\Ec2\Ec2Client;


    **Sample Code**

    .. code-block:: php

       $ec2Client = new Ec2Client([
           'region' => 'us-west-2',
           'version' => '2016-11-15',
       ]);


5. Add the instance profile to a running or stopped |EC2| instance. Use the instance profile name of your |IAM| role.

     **Sample Code**

    .. code-block:: php

       $result = $ec2Client->associateIamInstanceProfile([
          'IamInstanceProfile' => [
              'Arn' => $ARN
              'Name' => $IPN,
          ],
          'InstanceId' => $InstanceID
      ]);



For more information, see :EC2-ug:`IAM Roles for Amazon EC2<iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2>`.

.. _ecs_credentials:
 
Using |IAM| Roles for |ECS| Tasks
=================================

By using |IAM| roles for |ECSlong| (|ECS|) tasks, you can specify an |IAM| role that
the containers in a task can use. This is a strategy for managing credentials
for your applications to use, similar to the way that |EC2| instance profiles
provide credentials to |EC2| instances.

Instead of creating and distributing your AWS credentials to the containers or
using the |EC2| instance’s role, you can associate an |IAM| role with an ECS task definition or
``RunTask`` :aws-php-class:`API </api-ecs-2014-11-13.html#runtask>` operation.

.. note::

    Instance profile credentials and other temporary credentials generated by
    |STS| are not supported by every
    service. To determine whether the service you're using supports temporary
    credentials, see :iam-ug:`AWS Services that Support AWS STS <reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam>`.

For more information, see :EC2-ug:`IAM Roles for Amazon EC2 Container Service Tasks<task-iam-roles>`.


Assuming an |IAM| Role from Another AWS Account
===============================================

To assume a role from another AWS account (Account B), first you must create an IAM role in Account B. This role allows entities in other accounts,such as your account (Account A), to perform actions in Account B. 
For more information about cross-account access, see 
:iam-ug:`Tutorial: Delegate Access Across AWS Accounts Using IAM Roles <tutorial_cross-account-with-roles>`

After you create a role in Account B, record the role-arn. You will use this AR when you assume the role from Account A.
You assume the role using the AWS credentials associated with your entity in Account A

Create an |STS| client with credentials for your AWS account. Below we used a Credentials 
profile, but you can use any method. With the newly created STS client, call assume-role and 
provide a custom sessionName. Retrieve the new temporary credentials from the result. 
By default credentials last an hour.

**Sample Code**

    .. code-block:: php
    
        $stsClient = new Aws\Sts\StsClient([
            'profile' => 'default',
            'region' => 'us-east-2',
            'version' => '2011-06-15'
        ]);
        
        $ARN = "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/xaccounts3access";
        $sessionName = "s3-access-example";
        
        $result = $stsClient->AssumeRole([
              'RoleArn' => $ARN,
              'RoleSessionName' => $sessionName,
        ]);
        
         $s3Client = new S3Client([
            'version'     => '2006-03-01',
            'region'      => 'us-west-2',
            'credentials' =>  [
                'key'    => $result['Credentials']['AccessKeyId'],
                'secret' => $result['Credentials']['SecretAccessKey'],
                'token'  => $result['Credentials']['SessionToken']
            ]
        ]);

For more information, see :iam-ug:`Using IAM Roles <id_roles_use>` or 
:aws-php-class:`AssumeRole <api-sts-2011-06-15.html#assumerole>` in the |sdk-php| API Reference.

Using an |IAM| Role with Web Identity
=====================================

Web Identity Federation allows customers to use third-party identity providers for authentication when 
accessing AWS resources. Before you can assume a role with web identity, you must create an IAM Role and 
configure a web identity provider (IdP). 
For more information, see :iam-ug:`Creating a Role for Web Identity or OpenID Connect Federation (Console) <id_roles_create_for-idp_oidc>`.

After :iam-ug:`creating an identity <id_roles_providers_create_oidc>` and :iam-ug:`creating a role <id_roles_create_for-idp_oidc>`, use an |STS| client to authenticate a user. Provide the webIdentityToken and ProviderId for your identity, and the RoleArn for the IAM role with permissions for the user. 

**Sample Code**

    .. code-block:: php
    
        $stsClient = new Aws\Sts\StsClient([
            'profile' => 'default',
            'region' => 'us-east-2',
            'version' => '2011-06-15'
        ]);
        
        $ARN = "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/xaccounts3access";
        $sessionName = "s3-access-example";
        $duration = 3600;
        
        $result = $stsClient->AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity([
              'WebIdentityToken' => "FACEBOOK_ACCESS_TOKEN",
              'ProviderId' => "graph.facebook.com",
              'RoleArn' => $ARN,
              'RoleSessionName' => $sessionName,
        ]);
        
         $s3Client = new S3Client([
            'version'     => '2006-03-01',
            'region'      => 'us-west-2',
            'credentials' =>  [
                'key'    => $result['Credentials']['AccessKeyId'],
                'secret' => $result['Credentials']['SecretAccessKey'],
                'token'  => $result['Credentials']['SessionToken']
            ]
        ]);
