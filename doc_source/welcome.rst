What Is the |sdk-php| Version 3?
#################################

.. meta::
   :description: AWS SDK for PHP version 3 enables PHP developers to use Amazon Web Services in their PHP code.
   :keywords: AWS SDK for PHP version 3, AWS for PHP, Amazon PHP, 

The |sdk-php| Version 3 enables PHP developers to use  `Amazon Web Services <http://aws.amazon.com/>`_ 
in their PHP code, and build
robust applications and software using services like |S3|, |DDBlong|, |GL|, etc.
You can get started in minutes by installing the
SDK through Composer — by requiring the ``aws/aws-sdk-php`` package — or by
downloading the standalone `aws.zip <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-sdk-php/v3/download/aws.zip>`_
or `aws.phar <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-sdk-php/v3/download/aws.phar>`_ file.
