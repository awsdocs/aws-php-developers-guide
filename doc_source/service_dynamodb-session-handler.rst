The |DDB| Session Handler is a custom session handler for PHP that
enables developers to use |DDBlong| as a session store. Using |DDB|
for session storage alleviates issues that occur with session handling in a
distributed web application by moving sessions off of the local file system and
into a shared location. |DDB| is fast, scalable, easy to set up, and handles
replication of your data automatically.

The |DDB| Session Handler uses the ``session_set_save_handler()`` function
to hook |DDB| operations into PHP's `native session functions <http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.session.php>`_
to allow for a true drop in replacement. This includes support for features such as
session locking and garbage collection, which are a part of PHP's default
session handler.

For more information about the |DDB| service, see the
`Amazon DynamoDB homepage <https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/>`_.

Basic Usage
===========

Step 1: Register the Handler
----------------------------

First, instantiate and register the session handler.

.. code-block:: php

    use Aws\DynamoDb\SessionHandler;

    $sessionHandler = SessionHandler::fromClient($dynamoDb, [
        'table_name' => 'sessions'
    ]);

    $sessionHandler->register();

.. _create-a-table-for-storing-your-sessions:

Step 2. Create a Table to Store Your Sessions
---------------------------------------------

Before you can actually use the session handler, you need to create a table in
which to store the sessions. You can do this ahead of time by using the
`AWS Console for Amazon DynamoDB <https://console.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/home>`_,
or by using the |sdk-php|.

When creating this table use 'id' as the name of the primary key.  Also it is recommended
to setup a `Time To Live attribute <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/TTL.html>`_
using the 'expires' attribute to benefit from automatic garbage collection of sessions.

Step 3. Use PHP Sessions as You Normally Would
----------------------------------------------

Once the session handler is registered and the table exists, you can write to
and read from the session using the ``$_SESSION`` superglobal, just like you
normally do with PHP's default session handler. The |DDB| Session Handler
encapsulates and abstracts the interactions with |DDB| and enables
you to simply use PHP's native session functions and interface.

.. code-block:: php

    // Start the session
    session_start();

    // Alter the session data
    $_SESSION['user.name'] = 'jeremy';
    $_SESSION['user.role'] = 'admin';

    // Close the session (optional, but recommended)
    session_write_close();

Configuration
=============

You can configure the behavior of the session handler using the following
options. All options are optional, but be sure to understand
what the defaults are.

``table_name``
    The name of the |DDB| table in which to store the sessions. This defaults to ``'sessions'``.

``hash_key``
    The name of the hash key in the |DDB| sessions table. This defaults to ``'id'``.

``session_lifetime``
    The lifetime of an inactive session before it should be garbage collected. If it isn't provided, the actual
    lifetime value that will be used is ``ini_get('session.gc_maxlifetime')``.

``consistent_read``
    Whether the session handler should use consistent reads for the ``GetItem`` operation. The default
    is ``true``.

``locking``
    Whether to use session locking. The default is ``false``.

``batch_config``
    Configuration used to batch deletes during garbage collection. These options are passed directly into
    :aws-php-class:`DynamoDB WriteRequestBatch <class-Aws.DynamoDb.WriteRequestBatch.html>` objects.
    Manually trigger garbage collection via ``SessionHandler::garbageCollect()``.

``max_lock_wait_time``
    Maximum time (in seconds) that the session handler should wait to acquire a lock before giving up. The default
    to is ``10`` and is only used with session locking.

``min_lock_retry_microtime``
    Minimum time (in microseconds) that the session handler should wait between attempts to acquire a lock. The
    default is ``10000`` and is only used with session locking.

``max_lock_retry_microtime``
    Maximum time (in microseconds) that the session handler should wait between attempts to acquire a lock. The
    default is ``50000`` and is only used with session locking.

To configure the Session Handler, specify the configuration options when you instantiate the handler. The
following code is an example with all of the configuration options specified.

.. code-block:: php

    $sessionHandler = SessionHandler::fromClient($dynamoDb, [
        'table_name'               => 'sessions',
        'hash_key'                 => 'id',
        'session_lifetime'         => 3600,
        'consistent_read'          => true,
        'locking'                  => false,
        'batch_config'             => [],
        'max_lock_wait_time'       => 10,
        'min_lock_retry_microtime' => 5000,
        'max_lock_retry_microtime' => 50000,
    ]);

Pricing
=======

Aside from data storage and data transfer fees, the costs associated with using |DDB| are calculated based on
the provisioned throughput capacity of your table (see the `Amazon DynamoDB pricing details
<https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/pricing/>`_). Throughput is measured in units of write capacity and read capacity. The
|DDBlong| homepage says:

    A unit of read capacity represents one strongly consistent read per second (or two eventually consistent reads per
    second) for items as large as 4 KB. A unit of write capacity represents one write per second for items as large as
    1 KB.

Ultimately, the throughput and the costs required for your sessions table will correlate with your expected
traffic and session size. The following table explains the amount of read and write operations that are performed on
your |DDB| table for each of the session functions.

+-------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Read via ``session_start()``        | * 1 read operation (only 0.5 if ``consistent_read`` is ``false``).          |
|                                     | * (Conditional) 1 write operation to delete the session if it is expired.   |
+-------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Read via ``session_start()``        | * A minimum of 1 *write* operation.                                         |
| (Using session locking)             | * (Conditional) Additional write operations for each attempt at acquiring a |
|                                     |   lock on the session. Based on configured lock wait time and retry options.|
|                                     | * (Conditional) 1 write operation to delete the session if it is expired.   |
+-------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Write via ``session_write_close()`` | * 1 write operation.                                                        |
+-------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Delete via ``session_destroy()``    | * 1 write operation.                                                        |
+-------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Garbage Collection                  | * 0.5 read operations **per 4 KB of data in the table** to scan for expired |
|                                     |   sessions.                                                                 |
|                                     | * 1 write operation **per expired item** to delete it.                      |

.. _ddbsh-session-locking:

Session Locking
===============

The |DDB| Session Handler supports pessimistic session locking to mimic the behavior of PHP's default
session handler. By default, the |DDB| Session Handler has this feature *turned off* because it can become a performance
bottleneck and drive up costs, especially when an application accesses the session when using Ajax requests or iframes.
Carefully consider whether your application requires session locking before enabling it.

To enable session locking, set the ``'locking'`` option to ``true`` when you instantiate the ``SessionHandler``.

.. code-block:: php

    $sessionHandler = SessionHandler::fromClient($dynamoDb, [
        'table_name' => 'sessions',
        'locking'    => true,
    ]);

.. _ddbsh-garbage-collection:

Garbage Collection
==================

Setup a TTL attribute in your DynamoDB table, using the attribute 'expires'.  This will automatically garbage
collect your sessions and avoid the need to garbage collect them yourself.

Alternatively, the |DDB| Session Handler supports session garbage collection by using a series of ``Scan`` and ``BatchWriteItem``
operations. Due to the nature of how the ``Scan`` operation works, and to find all of the expired sessions and
delete them, the garbage collection process can require a lot of provisioned throughput.

For this reason, we do not support automated garbage collection. A better practice is to schedule the garbage
collection to occur during an off-peak time when a burst of consumed throughput will not disrupt the rest of the
application. For example, you could have a nightly cron job trigger a script to run the garbage collection. This script
would need to do something like the following.

.. code-block:: php

    $sessionHandler = SessionHandler::fromClient($dynamoDb, [
        'table_name'   => 'sessions',
        'batch_config' => [
            'batch_size' => 25,
            'before' => function ($command) {
                echo "About to delete a batch of expired sessions.\n";
            }
        ]
    ]);

    $sessionHandler->garbageCollect();

You can also use the ``'before'`` option within ``'batch_config'`` to introduce delays on the ``BatchWriteItem``
operations that are performed by the garbage collection process. This will increase the amount of time it takes the
garbage collection to complete, but it can help you spread out the requests made by the |DDB| Session Handler to
help you stay close to or within your provisioned throughput capacity during garbage collection.

.. code-block:: php

    $sessionHandler = SessionHandler::fromClient($dynamoDb, [
        'table_name'   => 'sessions',
        'batch_config' => [
            'before' => function ($command) {
                $command['@http']['delay'] = 5000;
            }
        ]
    ]);

    $sessionHandler->garbageCollect();

Best Practices
==============

#. Create your sessions table in an AWS Region that is geographically closest to or in the same Region as your application
   servers. This ensures the lowest latency between your application and |DDB| database.
#. Choose the provisioned throughput capacity of your sessions table carefully. Take into account the expected traffic
   to your application and the expected size of your sessions.  Alternatively use the 'On Demand' Read/Write capacity
   mode for your table.
#. Monitor your consumed throughput through the AWS Management Console or with |CWlong|, and adjust your
   throughput settings as needed to meet the demands of your application.
#. Keep the size of your sessions small (ideally less than 1 KB). Small sessions perform better and require less
   provisioned throughput capacity.
#. Do not use session locking unless your application requires it.
#. Instead of using PHP's built-in session garbage collection triggers, schedule your garbage collection via a cron job,
   or another scheduling mechanism, to run during off-peak hours. Use the ``'batch_config'`` option to your advantage.

Required |IAM| Permissions
==========================

To use the |DDB| SessionHhandler, your :doc:`configured credentials <guide_credentials>`
must have permission to use the |DDB| table that :ref:`you created in a previous step <create-a-table-for-storing-your-sessions>`.
The following |IAM| policy contains the minimum permissions that you need. To use this policy, replace the Resource value
with the |arnlong| (ARN) of the table that you created previously. For more information about creating and
attaching |IAM| policies, see :iam-ug:`Managing IAM Policies <access_policies_manage>`
in the |IAM-ug|.
