|AKFlong| allows you send real-time data to other AWS services including |AKS|, |S3|, |ES|, |RS| or Splunk. Create a data producer with Delivery Streams, 
which will deliver data to the configured destination every time you add data. 

The following examples show how to:

* Create a delivery stream using :aws-php-class:`CreateDeliveryStream <api-firehose-2015-08-04.html#createdeliverystream>`.
* Get details about a single delivery stream using :aws-php-class:`DescribeDeliveryStream <api-firehose-2015-08-04.html#describedeliverystream>`.
* List your delivery streams using :aws-php-class:`ListDeliveryStreams <api-firehose-2015-08-04.html#listdeliverystreams>`.
* Send Data to a delivery stream using :aws-php-class:`PutRecord <api-firehose-2015-08-04.html#putrecord>`.
* Delete a delivery stream using :aws-php-class:`DeleteDeliveryStream <api-firehose-2015-08-04.html#deletedeliverystream>`.

For more information about using |AKFlong|, see the |AKF-dg|_.

Create a Delivery Stream using a |AK| Data Stream
=================================================

Establish a Delivery Stream that will put data into a classic Kinesis Data Stream using the following code sample. 


**Imports**

.. literalinclude::  example_code/firehose/CreateDeliveryStream.php
   :lines: 20-23
   :language: PHP

**Sample Code**

.. literalinclude:: example_code/firehose/CreateDeliveryStream.php
   :lines: 33-
   :language: php

Create a Delivery Stream using an |S3| Bucket
=================================================

Establish a Delivery Stream that will put data into an existing |S3| Bucket using the following code sample. Provide the destination parameters as described in the :AKF-dg:`Destination Parameters <create-destination.html>` and ensure that you grant |AKF| access to your |S3| Bucket as described in :AKF-dg:`Grant Kinesis Data Firehose Access to an Amazon S3 Destination <controlling-access.html#using-iam-s3>`.


**Imports**

.. literalinclude::  example_code/firehose/CreateS3DeliveryStream.php

   :language: PHP

**Sample Code**

.. literalinclude:: example_code/firehose/CreateS3DeliveryStream.php
   :lines: 33-
   :language: php

Create a Delivery Stream using |ES|
===================================

Establish a Delivery Stream that will put data into an |ES| using the following code sample. Provide the destination parameters as described in the :AKF-dg:`Destination Parameters <create-destination.html>` and ensure that you grant |AKF| access to your |ES| cluster as described in :AKF-dg:`Grant Kinesis Data Firehose Access to an Amazon ES Destination <controlling-access.html#using-iam-es>`.

**Imports**

.. literalinclude::  example_code/firehose/CreateESDeliveryStream.php
   :lines: 20-23
   :language: PHP

**Sample Code**

.. literalinclude:: example_code/firehose/CreateESDeliveryStream.php
   :lines: 33-
   :language: php
   
   
Retrieve a Delivery Stream 
==========================

Get the details about an existing Delivery Stream using the following code sample. 


**Imports**

.. literalinclude::  example_code/firehose/DescribeDeliveryStream.php
   :lines: 20-23
   :language: PHP

**Sample Code**

.. literalinclude:: example_code/firehose/DescribeDeliveryStream.php
   :lines: 33-
   :language: php
   
List existing Delivery Streams connected to Kinesis
===================================================

List all the existing Delivery Streams sending data to Kinesis Data Streams using the following code sample. 


**Imports**

.. literalinclude::  example_code/firehose/ListKinesisDeliveryStreams.php
   :lines: 20-23
   :language: PHP

**Sample Code**

.. literalinclude:: example_code/firehose/ListKinesisDeliveryStreams.php
   :lines: 33-
   :language: php

List existing Delivery Streams sending to other |AWS| Services
=====================================================================

List all the existing Delivery Streams sending data to |S3|, |ES|, |RS| or Splunk using the following code sample. 


**Imports**

.. literalinclude::  example_code/firehose/ListDirectDeliveryStreams.php
   :lines: 20-23
   :language: PHP

**Sample Code**

.. literalinclude:: example_code/firehose/ListDirectDeliveryStreams.php
   :lines: 33-
   :language: php
   
   
Send Data to an existing Delivery Streams 
=========================================

Once you've created a Delivery Stream, use the following example to send data through Firehose Delivery Streams to your specified destination. 
After you create a Delivery Stream, use DescribeDeliveryStream to see if the Delivery Stream is active before sending data to it.  

**Imports**

.. literalinclude::  example_code/firehose/PutRecordtoDeliveryStream.php
   :lines: 20-23
   :language: PHP

**Sample Code**
