# What Is the AWS SDK for PHP Version 3?<a name="welcome"></a>

The AWS SDK for PHP Version 3 enables PHP developers to use [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) in their PHP code, and build robust applications and software using services like Amazon S3, Amazon DynamoDB, and S3 Glacier\. You can get started in minutes by installing the SDK through Composer — by requiring the `aws/aws-sdk-php` package — or by downloading the standalone [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-sdk-php/v3/download/aws.zip](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-sdk-php/v3/download/aws.zip) or [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-sdk-php/v3/download/aws.phar](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-sdk-php/v3/download/aws.phar) file\.

Not all services are immediately available in the SDK\. To find out which services are currently supported by the AWS SDK for PHP, see [Service Name and API Version](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-sdk-php/v3/api/index.html)\. For information about the AWS SDK for PHP Version 3 on GitHub, see [Additional Resources](resources.md)\.

**Note**  
If you’re migrating your code from using Version 2 of the SDK to Version 3, be sure to read [Upgrading from Version 2 of the AWS SDK for PHP](getting-started_migration.md)\.
