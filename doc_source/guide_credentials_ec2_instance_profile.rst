Using |IAM| Roles for |EC2| Instance Variable Credentials
==========================================================

If you're running your application on an |EC2| instance, the preferred way to provide credentials to
make calls to AWS is to use an :ec2-ug:`IAM role <iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2>`
to get temporary security credentials.

When you use |IAM| roles, you don't need to worry about
credential management from your application. They allow an instance to "assume" a role by retrieving temporary
credentials from the |EC2| instance's metadata server.

The temporary credentials, often referred to as **instance profile credentials**, allow
access to the actions and resources that the role's policy allows. |EC2| handles all the legwork of securely
authenticating instances to the |IAM| service to assume the role, and periodically
refreshing the retrieved role credentials. This keeps your application secure with
almost no work on your part.

.. note::

    Instance profile credentials and other temporary credentials generated by
    the |STSlong| (|STS|) are not supported by every
    service. To determine whether the service you're using supports temporary
    credentials, see :iam-ug:`AWS Services that Support AWS STS <reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam>`.

    To avoid hitting the metadata service every time, you can pass an instance of ``Aws\CacheInterface``
    in as the ``'credentials'`` option to a client constructor. This lets the SDK
    use cached instance profile credentials instead. For details, see :doc:`guide_configuration`.
    
   
Use Credentials from an |EC2| Instance Profile
-------------------------------------------------

1. Create an |IAM| client.

    **Imports**

    .. code-block:: php

       require 'vendor/autoload.php';

       use Aws\Iam\IamClient;


    **Sample Code**

    .. code-block:: php

       $client = new IamClient([
           'region' => 'us-west-2',
           'version' => '2010-05-08'
       ]);

2. Create an |IAM| role with the permissions for the actions and resources you'll use.

    **Sample Code**

     .. code-block:: php

       $result = $client->createRole([
           'AssumeRolePolicyDocument' => 'IAM JSON Policy', // REQUIRED
           'Description' => 'Description of Role',
           'RoleName' => 'RoleName', // REQUIRED
       ]);




3. Create an |IAM| instance profile and store the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) from the result.

    .. note::

        If you use the |IAM| console instead of the |sdk-php|, the console creates an instance profile automatically and gives it the same name as the role to which it corresponds.

     **Sample Code**

     .. code-block:: php

       $IPN = 'InstanceProfileName';

       $result = $client->createInstanceProfile([
           'InstanceProfileName' => $IPN ,
       ]);

       $ARN = $result['Arn'];
       $InstanceID =  $result['InstanceProfileId'];



4. Create an |EC2| client.

    **Imports**

    .. code-block:: php

       require 'vendor/autoload.php';

       use Aws\Ec2\Ec2Client;


    **Sample Code**

    .. code-block:: php

       $ec2Client = new Ec2Client([
           'region' => 'us-west-2',
           'version' => '2016-11-15',
       ]);


5. Add the instance profile to a running or stopped |EC2| instance. Use the instance profile name of your |IAM| role.

     **Sample Code**

    .. code-block:: php

       $result = $ec2Client->associateIamInstanceProfile([
          'IamInstanceProfile' => [
              'Arn' => $ARN
              'Name' => $IPN,
          ],
          'InstanceId' => $InstanceID
      ]);

.. _ecs_credentials:
 
Using |IAM| Roles for |ECS| Tasks
=================================

By using |IAM| roles for |ECSlong| (|ECS|) tasks, you can specify an |IAM| role that
the containers in a task can use. This is a strategy for managing credentials
for your applications to use, similar to the way that |EC2| instance profiles
provide credentials to |EC2| instances.

Instead of creating and distributing your AWS credentials to the containers or
using the |EC2| instance’s role, you can associate an |IAM| role with an ECS task definition or
``RunTask`` :aws-php-class:`API </api-ecs-2014-11-13.html#runtask>` operation.

.. note::

    Instance profile credentials and other temporary credentials generated by
    |STS| are not supported by every
    service. To determine whether the service you're using supports temporary
    credentials, see :iam-ug:`AWS Services that Support AWS STS <reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam>`.

For more information, see :EC2-ug:`IAM Roles for Amazon EC2 Container Service Tasks<task-iam-roles>`.
