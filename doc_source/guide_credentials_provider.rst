Using a Credential Provider
###########################

   :description: How to configure anonymous access for AWS Services using the AWS SDK for PHP.
   :keywords:

.. _credential_provider:

A credential provider is a function that returns a ``GuzzleHttp\Promise\PromiseInterface``
that is fulfilled with an ``Aws\Credentials\CredentialsInterface`` instance or
rejected with an ``Aws\Exception\CredentialsException``. You can use credential
providers to implement your own custom logic for creating credentials or to
optimize credential loading.

Credential providers are passed into the ``credentials`` client constructor
option. Credential providers are asynchronous, which forces them to be lazily
evaluated each time an API operation is invoked. As such, passing in a
credential provider function to an SDK client constructor doesn't immediately
validate the credentials. If the credential provider doesn't return a
credentials object, an API operation will be rejected with an
``Aws\Exception\CredentialsException``.

.. code-block:: php

    use Aws\Credentials\CredentialProvider;
    use Aws\S3\S3Client;

    // Use the default credential provider
    $provider = CredentialProvider::defaultProvider();

    // Pass the provider to the client
    $client = new S3Client([
        'region'      => 'us-west-2',
        'version'     => '2006-03-01',
        'credentials' => $provider
    ]);
    
Built-In Providers in the SDK
=============================

The SDK provides several built-in providers that you can combine
with any custom providers.

.. important::

    Credential providers are invoked every time an API operation is performed.
    If loading credentials is an expensive task (e.g., loading from disk or a
    network resource), or if credentials are not cached by your provider,
    consider wrapping your credential provider in an
    ``Aws\Credentials\CredentialProvider::memoize`` function. The default
    credential provider used by the SDK is automatically memoized.

    
assumeRole provider
===================

If you use ``Aws\Credentials\AssumeRoleCredentialProvider`` to create credentials by assuming a role,
you need to provide ``'client'`` information with an ``StsClient`` object and
``'assume_role_params'`` details, as shown.

.. note::

   To avoid unnecessarily fetching |STS| credentials on every API operation, you can use
   the ``memoize`` function to handle automatically refreshing the credentials when they expire.
   See the following code for an example.

.. code-block:: php

    use Aws\Credentials\CredentialProvider;
    use Aws\S3\S3Client;
    use Aws\Sts\StsClient;

    // Passing Aws\Credentials\AssumeRoleCredentialProvider options directly
    $assumeRoleCredentials = new AssumeRoleCredentialProvider([
        'client' => new StsClient([
            'region' => 'us-west-2',
            'version' => '2011-06-15'
        ]),
        'assume_role_params' => [
            'RoleArn' => 'arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/role_name',
            'RoleSessionName' => 'test_session',
        ]
    ]);

    // To avoid unnecessarily fetching STS credentials on every API operation,
    // the memoize function handles automatically refreshing the credentials when they expire
    $provider = CredentialProvider::memoize($assumeRoleCredentials);

    $client = new S3Client([
        'region'      => 'us-west-2',
        'version'     => 'latest',
        'credentials' => $provider
    ]);


For more information regarding ``'assume_role_params'``, see :aws-php-class:`AssumeRole </api-sts-2011-06-15.html#assumerole>`.

Chaining Providers
==================

You can chain credential providers by using the
``Aws\Credentials\CredentialProvider::chain()`` function. This function accepts
a variadic number of arguments, each of which are credential provider
functions. This function then returns a new function that's the composition of
the provided functions, such that they are invoked one after the other until one
of the providers returns a promise that is fulfilled successfully.

The ``defaultProvider`` uses this composition to check multiple
providers before failing. The source of the ``defaultProvider`` demonstrates
the use of the ``chain`` function.

.. code-block:: php

    // This function returns a provider
    public static function defaultProvider(array $config = [])
    {
        // This function is the provider, which is actually the composition
        // of multiple providers. Notice that we are also memoizing the result by
        // default.
        return self::memoize(
            self::chain(
                self::env(),
                self::ini(),
                self::instanceProfile($config)
            )
        );
    }

Creating a Custom Provider
==========================

Credential providers are simply functions that when invoked return a promise
(``GuzzleHttp\Promise\PromiseInterface``) that is fulfilled with an
``Aws\Credentials\CredentialsInterface`` object or rejected with an
``Aws\Exception\CredentialsException``.

A best practice for creating providers is to create a function that is invoked
to create the actual credential provider. As an example, here's the source of
the ``env`` provider (slightly modified for example purposes). Notice that it
is a function that returns the actual provider function. This allows you to
easily compose credential providers and pass them around as values.

.. code-block:: php

    use GuzzleHttp\Promise;
    use GuzzleHttp\Promise\RejectedPromise;

    // This function CREATES a credential provider
    public static function env()
    {
        // This function IS the credential provider
        return function () {
            // Use credentials from environment variables, if available
            $key = getenv(self::ENV_KEY);
            $secret = getenv(self::ENV_SECRET);
            if ($key && $secret) {
                return Promise\promise_for(
                    new Credentials($key, $secret, getenv(self::ENV_SESSION))
                );
            }

            $msg = 'Could not find environment variable '
                . 'credentials in ' . self::ENV_KEY . '/' . self::ENV_SECRET;
            return new RejectedPromise(new CredentialsException($msg));
        };
    }
    
    
defaultProvider provider
========================

``Aws\Credentials\CredentialProvider::defaultProvider`` is the default
credential provider. This provider is used if you omit a ``credentials`` option
when creating a client. It first attempts to load credentials from environment
variables, then from an .ini file (an ``.aws/credentials`` file first, followed by an ``.aws/config`` file),
and then from an instance profile (``EcsCredentials`` first, followed by ``Ec2`` metadata).

.. note::

    The result of the default provider is automatically memoized.

ecsCredentials provider
=======================

``Aws\Credentials\CredentialProvider::ecsCredentials`` attempts to load
credentials by a ``GET`` request, whose URI is specified by the environment variable
``AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_RELATIVE_URI`` in the container.

.. code-block:: php

    use Aws\Credentials\CredentialProvider;
    use Aws\S3\S3Client;

    $provider = CredentialProvider::ecsCredentials();
    // Be sure to memoize the credentials
    $memoizedProvider = CredentialProvider::memoize($provider);

    $client = new S3Client([
        'region'      => 'us-west-2',
        'version'     => '2006-03-01',
        'credentials' => $memoizedProvider
    ]);


env provider
============

``Aws\Credentials\CredentialProvider::env`` attempts to load credentials from
environment variables.

.. code-block:: php

    use Aws\Credentials\CredentialProvider;
    use Aws\S3\S3Client;

    $client = new S3Client([
        'region'      => 'us-west-2',
        'version'     => '2006-03-01',
        'credentials' => CredentialProvider::env()
    ]);

ini provider
============

``Aws\Credentials\CredentialProvider::ini`` attempts to load credentials from
an :doc:`ini credential file <guide_credentials_profiles>`. By default, the SDK
attempts to load the "default" profile from a file located at
``~/.aws/credentials``.

.. code-block:: php

    use Aws\Credentials\CredentialProvider;
    use Aws\S3\S3Client;

    $provider = CredentialProvider::ini();
    // Cache the results in a memoize function to avoid loading and parsing
    // the ini file on every API operation
    $provider = CredentialProvider::memoize($provider);

    $client = new S3Client([
        'region'      => 'us-west-2',
        'version'     => '2006-03-01',
        'credentials' => $provider
    ]);

You can use a custom profile or .ini file location by providing arguments to
the function that creates the provider.

.. code-block:: php

    $profile = 'production';
    $path = '/full/path/to/credentials.ini';

    $provider = CredentialProvider::ini($profile, $path);
    $provider = CredentialProvider::memoize($provider);

    $client = new S3Client([
        'region'      => 'us-west-2',
        'version'     => '2006-03-01',
        'credentials' => $provider
    ]);

instanceProfile provider
========================

``Aws\Credentials\CredentialProvider::instanceProfile`` attempts to load
credentials from |EC2| instance profiles.

.. code-block:: php

    use Aws\Credentials\CredentialProvider;
    use Aws\S3\S3Client;

    $provider = CredentialProvider::instanceProfile();
    // Be sure to memoize the credentials
    $memoizedProvider = CredentialProvider::memoize($provider);

    $client = new S3Client([
        'region'      => 'us-west-2',
        'version'     => '2006-03-01',
        'credentials' => $memoizedProvider
    ]);

.. note::

    You can disable this attempt to load from |EC2| instance profiles by
    setting the ``AWS_EC2_METADATA_DISABLED`` environment variable to ``true``.

Memoizing Credentials
=====================

At times you might need to create a credential provider that remembers the
previous return value. This can be useful for performance when loading
credentials is an expensive operation or when using the ``Aws\Sdk`` class to
share a credential provider across multiple clients. You can add memoization to
a credential provider by wrapping the credential provider function in a
``memoize`` function.

.. code-block:: php

    use Aws\Credentials\CredentialProvider;

    $provider = CredentialProvider::instanceProfile();
    // Wrap the actual provider in a memoize function
    $provider = CredentialProvider::memoize($provider);

    // Pass the provider into the Sdk class and share the provider
    // across multiple clients. Each time a new client is constructed,
    // it will use the previously returned credentials as long as
    // they haven't yet expired.
    $sdk = new Aws\Sdk(['credentials' => $provider]);

    $s3 = $sdk->getS3(['region' => 'us-west-2', 'version' => 'latest']);
    $ec2 = $sdk->getEc2(['region' => 'us-west-2', 'version' => 'latest']);

    assert($s3->getCredentials() === $ec2->getCredentials());

When the memoized credentials are expired, the memoize wrapper invokes
the wrapped provider in an attempt to refresh the credentials.
